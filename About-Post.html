      <p>This is a place where you can find my personal blog, reviews, and media-ventures! Each part of the site and its content was created by me, and in general it is a site about me and my life, as well as what I create. As of now, the pages are mostly empty, but eventually they will flourish with content. To find out more about me, click <a href="about-me.html">here</a>.
